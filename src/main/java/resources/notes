** Best Practices **

* Use softassertions for pageValidation tests so all elements will be tested
* Label page object - assert equals expected text
* Input field or button - assert true isEnabled 
* Remove all outputs to console before committing code for test creation/updates
----------------------------------------------

** Troubleshooting **

* ElementNotFound - 
	(1) Use Thread.sleep(20000), if resolved set wait for presence of element
	(2) Use MyActions > focus... method to get focus
	(3) Use Xpath, System.out.println(driver.getPageSource()), copy PageSource to notepad,
	 find block with element, use that block to create Xpath
	 
* Element not working, but not generating error - 
	(1) There could be another element in the background with same locator,
	 use Xpath to specify index of element to be used
 
 * Window needed has same Native Window Handle as a window in the background - 
 	(1) Use this in test class to get all Native Window Handles,
 	 System.out.println("WindowHandles: "+driver.getWindowHandles());
 	 then, use MyActions.focusByNativeWindowHandleIndex to indicate which 
 	 Native Window Handle to give focus
